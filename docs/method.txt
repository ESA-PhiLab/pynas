Our work presents a hardware-aware Neural Architecture Search (NAS) framework for real-time AI inference onboard satellites, optimized for power- and memory-constrained CubeSat hardware. By integrating hardware-in-the-loop profiling, our method discovers ultra-efficient models—some under 1k parameters—that outperform baselines in latency and accuracy. This capability is crucial for time-sensitive applications like wildfire response, where onboard processing enables sub-hour decision-making. Complementing prior work on unsupervised change detection, our approach supports supervised semantic segmentation, broadening the scope of real-time Earth observation from orbit.
